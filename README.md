# node-task-manager

This is a simple app that I made while following along with the course The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) on Udemy. This app is a REST API that allows users to do the following:

**User Management**
* Create an account
* Login/logout
* Delete their account 
* View their profile
* Edit their profile
* Upload an avatar 

**Task Management**
* View all tasks with optional filters
* View a single task
* Create a new task
* Edit a task/mark as completed
* Delete a task
